      <p>Welcome to the land of <em class="notagotchi">Nota-gotchi.</em> They are lovable creatures that need food, sleep, and fun to grow and live long, enjoyable lives.</p>
      <p>As your pet, your <span class="notagotchi">Nota-gotchi</span> needs each of its three basic needs; food, sleep, and play, every five minutes. Thankfully it takes no time at all to play, feed, or put your Nota-gotchi to bed.</p>
      <p>Your <span class="notagotchi">Nota-gotchi</span> will grow an age every seven minutes. See it transform and grow over time! Your <span class="notagotchi">Nota-gotchi</span> will also alert you when it needs something. Eventually, your <span class="notagotchi">Nota-gotchi</span> will age and pass, but a new egg will be waiting for you!</p>
